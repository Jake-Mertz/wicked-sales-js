Burstbucker pickups and handwired electronics deliver a massive tone arsenal.","When it comes to capturing vintage Patent Applied For (PAF) humbucker tone, nothing beats the sound of this Les Paul Standard’s Burstbucker 61 pickups.

These magnets — along with period-correct unmatched windings on the bobbins — capture the subtle historical variations in true humbucker tone. Plug into your favorite amp, and experience smooth low-end response, complex midrange crunch, and sweet-sounding highs. These pickups sound great clean or they can be used to push your amp into overdrive for the legendary fat, snarling tone you can only get with a humbucker. Under the hood, the control assembly is handwired with matched potentiometers and Orange Drop capacitors, ensuring that you’ll hear the mellifluous voice of your Les Paul Standard ’60s in all its glory, even when you back down your volume."
